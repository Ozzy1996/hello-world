Hello World Project

My name is Osvaldo Suarez, or Ozzy for short. I was born in Clarksville, Tennessee and currently live in Evans, Georgia. I graduated at Georgia Military College with two Associate Degrees: Associate of Science in General Studies and Associate of Science in Information Technology. My long term plan is to pursue a career as a front end web developer.

My hobbies include playing video games, doing exercises, and hanging out with friends.
